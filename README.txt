Welcome to Bens Javascript Loan Calculator 
*Version 1.0.0*

this script allows you to specify:

- loan amount
- interest rate 
- repayment length 

and in return you will be given:

- monthly repayment cost
- total payment after interest
- total amount of interest

This script is free to use, I used a basic bootsrap UI that can easily be converted to any other framework or vanilla html/css. 

Why did i make this app?
To get a better understanding of javascript and familiarise myself with a commonly used method of operation.
